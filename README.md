# Cycle Detection in Directed Graphs (CSC3110 Project 5)
Team: Christian Larsen, Deboshree Chowdhury, Tawheed Mokamme & Abrar Mohammedâ€‹ 
## Overview
This project implements two algorithms to detect cycles in a directed graph using an adjacency matrix representation. The algorithms identify all possible cycles in the graph and output them as ordered sequences of vertices.

## Problem Statement
Given a set of vertices and a set of edges in an adjacency matrix, the task is to determine all existing cycles (if any) in a directed graph.

### Input
- **Vertices**: A list of vertex names (e.g., `A, B, C, D, E`).
- **Adjacency Matrix**: A 2D array where:
  - A positive number represents the edge weight between two vertices.
  - `-999` represents infinity (no edge exists between vertices).

### Output
- **Detected Cycles**: A list of cycles, where each cycle is an ordered sequence of vertices.
